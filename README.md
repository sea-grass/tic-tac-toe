#tic-tac-toe-ception

Basically when you play a game and it is completed, it is counted as a single move in a larger tic-tac-toe game. There's always more to it.

Progress:
 - Have basic simple game loop going
 - Have winner notification -- although no proper win sequence checking
 - Have game over -- Although it only runs once all squares are filled
Todo:
 - Make the simple game count as a move in a larger game
 - Implement win-sequence checking after each move
